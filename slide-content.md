---
### BuckleScript

1 Reason file ‚Üí 1 JS file

Use the JS files as normal
---
All you need: **bsconfig.json** and **`bsb`**
---
#### Minimal bsconfig.json

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "sources": {
    "dir": "src"
  }
}
```

---
#### `bsb`

```nohighlight
npm install -g bs-platform
```

```nohighlight
bsb -make-world [-w]
```

---
```reasonml
EventTargetRe.addKeyDownEventListener(
  ‚Ä¶
  ‚Ä¶
);
```

---

```reasonml
EventTargetRe.addKeyDownEventListener(
  ‚Ä¶
  DocumentRe.asEventTarget(Webapi.Dom.document)
);
```

---

```reasonml
EventTargetRe.addKeyDownEventListener(
  self.state.keyDownHandler^,
  DocumentRe.asEventTarget(Webapi.Dom.document)
);
```

---
```reasonml
EventTargetRe.addKeyDownEventListener(
  self.state.keyDownHandler^,
  DocumentRe.asEventTarget(Webapi.Dom.document)
);
```

```javascript
document.addEventListener("keydown",
  self[/* state */1][/* keyDownHandler */2][0]);
```

TLDR; You can already write entire JS apps in pure Reason! üéâ

Remember `external`?
---
```reasonml
external cStrcmp: string => string => int = "strcmp";
```

```reasonml
[@bs.val] btoa: string => string = "btoa";
```

```reasonml
let encodedData = btoa("Hi, FrontConf!");
```

---
But first, check for existing bindings!
---
![redex.github.io](img/redex.png)
---
Add it to `bs-dependencies` in bsconfig.json:

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "sources": {
    "dir": "src"
  },
  "bs-dependencies": [
    "bs-webapi"
  ]
}
```

**Don't forget package.json!**
