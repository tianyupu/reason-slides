### BuckleScript

1 Reason file ‚Üí 1 JS file

Use the JS files as normal

JS files are human-readable!
---
All you need: **bsconfig.json** and **`bsb`**
---
#### Minimal bsconfig.json

```json
{
  "name": "my-project",
  "sources": {
    "dir": "src"
  }
}
```

---
#### `bsb`

```nohighlight
npm install -g bs-platform
```

```nohighlight
bsb -make-world [-w]
```

---
```nohighlight
my-project/
  src/
  package.json
  bsconfig.json
```

---
TLDR; You can already write entire JS apps in pure Reason! üéâ
